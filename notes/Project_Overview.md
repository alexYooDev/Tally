- I want a dashboard page, so that I can see cash flows in a single view.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Attributes are Date, Client Name, Service, Price, Discount, Total Received, Payment (Price - Discounted Price), Payment Method, Notes.
- Dashboard provides line charts for cash flow view (adjustable time frame), a pie chart for top most of popular services/products (adjustable time frame).

- I want to filter the incomes/spendings by certain period window (day/week/month/year), so that it is easy for me to view the cash flow in certain period of time

- I want my specific service management page where I can CRUD my services or products, so that, when I log my income I can select which service produced income

Acceptance Criteria:
- For MVP1, prices are set to AUD
